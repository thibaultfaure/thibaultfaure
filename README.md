### Welcome on my personal home page

My name is Thibault Faure, I am a French senior developer, but currently the two languages I use at work are Spanish and English :).

I've had the chance to work for various kinds of businesses. I've worked both as a fullstack and a back-end developer.

I mainly use my github account to post the code related to the articles I write for Baeldung. Baeldung is the worldwide reference for tutorials on Java/Spring topics.

Here are the articles I've written for Baeldung:
- https://www.baeldung.com/spring-autowired-field-null
- https://www.baeldung.com/java-acquire-lock-by-key
- https://www.baeldung.com/spring-injecting-all-annotated-beans
- https://www.baeldung.com/java-scanner-usedelimiter
- https://www.baeldung.com/java-unit-test-private-methods
- https://www.baeldung.com/git-commit-message-changes
- https://www.baeldung.com/java-clear-stringbuilder-stringbuffer
- https://www.baeldung.com/java-validate-xml-xsd

I've also contributed to improving the following articles:

- https://www.baeldung.com/java-sealed-classes-interfaces
